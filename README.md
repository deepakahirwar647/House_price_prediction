# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements a simple **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and other variables. The model is trained using Python and the `scikit-learn` library.

---

## 📊 Objective

To build and evaluate a **Linear Regression** model that can estimate the price of a house given input features such as:

- Area (in square feet)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Location (optional with one-hot encoding)
- Other customizable features
